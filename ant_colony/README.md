- number of iterations
    - `num = 350` is the best value. the higher the number of iterations the better.
        - `num = 10` vs `num = 350`
            - `num = 10` won 1/100 times
            - `num = 350` won 91/100 times
        - `num = 50` vs `num = 300`
            - `num = 50` won 12/100 times
            - `num = 300` won 73/100 times

            - `num = 100` won 23/100 times
            - `num = 250` won 64/100 times
        - `num = 150` vs `num = 200`
            - `num = 150` won 40/100 times
            - `num = 200` won 43/100 times
        - `num = 350` vs `num = 250`
            - `num = 350` won 52/100 times
            - `num = 250` won 33/100 times
- initial pheromone level
    - the value doesnt seem to have much effect on the result
- pheromone evaporation rate
    - the value doesnt seem to have much effect on the result
- number of ants
    - the value doesnt seem to have much effect on the result
    - but it does have an effect on the time
        - so we will go for a smaller number of ants (around 50)
